DNS:

55) List type of DNS records and their usage

The main use of A record is for IP address lookup. Using an A record, a web browser is able to load a website using the domain name. As a result, we can access websites on the internet without knowing their IP addresses.
2. AAAA record
AAAA record, just like A record, point to the IP address for a domain. However, this DNS record type is different in the sense that it points to IPV6 addresses.
3. CNAME record
In a CNAME record, the alias doesn't point to an IP address. And the domain name that the alias points to is the canonical name.
4. NS record
A nameserver (NS) record specifies the authoritative DNS server for a domain. In other words, the NS record helps point to where internet applications like a web browser can find the IP address for a domain name. Usually, multiple nameservers are specified for a domain. 
56) How to check DNS records for a domain?

nslookup = nslookup abc.com
